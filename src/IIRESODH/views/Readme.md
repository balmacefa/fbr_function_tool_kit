# ChatHTMX Module Documentation

This comprehensive guide provides an overview of the ChatHTMX module's file structure and content. It is intended to assist onboarding for new collaborators by saving time in understanding the functional parts of the chat system.

## src/ChatHTMX/views Directory

This directory contains the EJS templates that define the user interface of the chat application. Here's a brief summary of the main files within this directory:

- **base_layout.ejs**: Sets the HTML structure and includes CDN links for Tailwind CSS, HTMX, FontAwesome, and jQuery.
- **chat_app.ejs**: The main chat application layout integrating the sidebar with the main content area. It uses conditional rendering to display chat contents.
- **chat_chatlog_messages.ejs**: Renders a list of chat messages by looping through each message data and including the `chat_single_message` partial.
- **chat_input_area.ejs**: Contains a form for the user to input new messages. This form is enhanced with HTMX attributes to enable asynchronous behavior.
- **chat_single_message.ejs**: Template for individual chat messages; includes message content and metadata like timestamps.
- **chat_top_ops.ejs**: Defines the top operations bar within the chat area, which may include buttons for additional user actions.
- **layout.ejs**: Provides a basic layout structure that is extended by other EJS templates within the views directory.
- **main_content_chat.ejs**: The content section of the chat interface, including chat messages log and input area.
- **main_content_no_chat.ejs**: A placeholder content area displayed when there are no active chats.
- **new_chat_button.ejs**: Contains the button element to start a new chat session within the sidebar.
- **sidebar.ejs**: Defines the sidebar layout that contains links to different parts of the chat application.
- **sidebar_app_menu.ejs**: Includes the application-specific menu that is part of the sidebar.
- **sidebar_chat_item_link.ejs**: Renders a single chat item link in the sidebar list of conversations.
- **sidebar_chat_item_link_loop.ejs**: Used to loop through and render each chat item in the sidebar.
- **sidebar_chat_list.ejs**: The main list component in the sidebar that displays all active chat sessions.

Each file has been equipped with functionalities that work together to create an interactive and dynamic chat application experience. Use this guide to familiarize yourself with the role of each file and navigate the project more efficiently.
