To create a comprehensive test case plan for the AI-to-AI Query Language Tool, we'll focus on the key features and functionalities as outlined in the project documentation. The test cases will ensure that each aspect of the tool, from basic querying to advanced operations like batch modifications and deep fetching, works as expected.

# General Structure for Test Cases

Each test case will typically include:

- Test Case ID: A unique identifier for the test.
  Description: A brief description of what the test will cover.
- Preconditions: Any prerequisites or setup required before executing the test.
- Test Steps: Detailed steps for executing the test.
- Expected Results: What the outcome should be if the test is successful.
- Actual Results: The actual outcome of the test (filled during testing).
- Status: Pass/Fail status (filled during testing).
